# HTWDD-Beamer-Theme
An inoffizial presentation theme of the University of Applied Sciences Dresden (HTWDD) for LaTeX Beamer


## Background

This beamer theme is a custom theme, styled with simpliness in mind.
The design and first version without tikz was made by Hermann Lorenz.
This version was used in many student presentations between 2012 and 2014.
Angelos Drossos decided to refactor this theme using technics provided by tikz.


## Requirements

This beamer theme requires the following packages to be able to compile:

 * ifthen
 * TikZ (pgf)
 * shellesc (only needed when the LaTeX shell escape feature is used)

From the TikZ package, the following libraries are used:

 * math
 * calc
 * external

The example representation is compileable with PDFLaTeX and LuaLaTeX.


## Usage

In the presentation, use the following command
between the \documentclass{beamer} command and the \begin{document} command
to enable the HTWDD beamer theme:

  \usetheme{HTWDD}

Keep in mind that the LaTeX compiler must be able to find the HTWDD beamer theme,
namely beamerthemeHTWDD.sty, beamercolorthemeHTWDD.sty, et cetera.

There are two major possibilities to install the HTWDD beamer theme:

  (a) Copy the theme files to your presentation folder,
      i.e. where your presentation.tex file is.
  (b) Install the theme files in any TeX search path folder,
      typically <HOME>/texmf.

Variant (a) is the easy and recommended method.
The section Installation (advanced usage) describes Variant (b) in more detail.


## Installation (advanced usage)

The first step is to find the texmf home directory (<TEXMFHOME>).
Typically, the texmf home directory should be one of the following paths:

 * ~/texmf (Linux)
 * C:/Users/<user>/texmf (Windows)

Most LaTeX distributions like TeXLive and MiKTeX include a path lookup tool
like kpsewich to find it:

 * kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFHOME

Regarding MiKTeX, have a look at the section "Installing sty or cls files"
in the answer to the question "How can I manually install a package on MiKTeX (Windows)".

It is recommended to install the HTWDD beamer theme in its own subfolder,
e.g.:

 * <TEXMFHOME>/tex/latex/beamerthemeHTWDD/beamerthemeHTWDD.sty
 * <TEXMFHOME>/tex/latex/beamerthemeHTWDD/beamercolorthemeHTWDD.sty
 * <TEXMFHOME>/tex/latex/beamerthemeHTWDD/beamerinnerthemeHTWDD.sty
 * <TEXMFHOME>/tex/latex/beamerthemeHTWDD/beamerouterthemeHTWDD.sty

When the LaTeX compiler shows the following error message or something similar,

  ! LaTeX Error: File `beamerthemeHTWDD.sty' not found.

then the HTWDD beamer theme is not in any search path
used by the LaTeX compiler.


## TikZ Externalization Library

This beamer theme supports the TikZ Externalization Library.

  The TikZ Externalization Library provides a high-level automatic or
  semiâ€“automatic export feature for TikZ pictures. Its purpose is to
  convert each picture to a separate pdf without changing the document
  as such.

This library needs the shell scape feature of LaTeX, which is disabled
by default due to security reasons. The shell escape feature enables
the LaTeX compiler to use system calls to be able to generate separate
PDF files for each TikZ picture. In other words, the LaTeX compiler
calls himself with the TikZ picture as main tex file.

To use the support of externalization library, the user must activate
the LaTeX shell escape (\write18) feature by using the command-line option:

 * TeXLive: -shell-escape
 * MiKTeX: -enable-write18

The beamer theme then detects this usage and enables the externalization
by using the command \tikzexternalize and loads the shellesc package.
The shellesc package is needed in combination with LuaLaTeX.
